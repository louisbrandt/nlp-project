It isn\\'t everyone\\'s cup of tea though. For example- the hard core black metal music is too much for me to handle because of the discord in the musical beat itself. I think the closest I\\'ve gotten to any of that would be Behemoth or Slayer (Slayer is not black metal).\\n\\nI didn\\'t count the 2 quick wind instrument songs on this album in the scoring. There were two songs- Signal the Storm and Lay Down Thy Burdens that came out OK.- I really liked this album. Both of those songs were OK- just not enough to rank them any higher. I likes Warriors In Carrion Kingdoms, Wolf, Wisdom, Silence and Bow to None the best.\\n\\nI\\'ll give this album a 4.2/5.0 (84%). Definitely worth picking up if you like Viking/Folk metal.

I sought it out primarily for \"Pieces of Me,\" but seeing contributions by Informatik, Seabound, Mesh, Ghost & Writer, among others made it a keeper.\\n\\nThe Birthday Massacre\\'s take on Skold\\'s \"Tonight\" I thought was superior to the Anomie version (but then I\\'m also pretty keen on TBM lately with the release of Hide and Seek.) KMFDM\\'s \"Amnesia\" is pretty standard fare for them, but it brings guitars along with the beats, which is nice. As you might expect the rougher edge of this compilation is found with Front Line Assembly\\'s \"Angriff\" and Encephalon\\'s \"The Transhuman Condition,\" which is also a danceable tune.\\n\\nAdding some atmosphere, we have Seabound\\'s contribution of \"The Escape\" as does Informatik\\'s \"World of Wonder,\" a touching track in the same vein as their album Beyond. Makes me hungry for both of their next releases! This mix of Ghost & Writer\\'s \"Fraud\" is fairly pared down at first, but I love the last half compared to the two versions included on their album \"Shipwrecks.\" Stromkern\\'s \"Ruin(ed)\" adds a dash of hip-hop flavor with their beats and vocals. I\\'m not really familiar with Dismantled, but I wouldn\\'t mind auditioning other tracks based on what I heard here, despite the auto-tuney vocals.\\n\\nOverall, the mix of sounds isn\\'t too heavy in any one area.

       "  'reviewText': \"For fans of the New Seekers, that very fine vocal group of the 1970's, this LP,released in September,1973, which I do not believe was ever re-released on CD,brings back the male voices of that original group, Marty Kristian, Paul Layton, and the later Peter Oliver who had replaced the late Peter Doyle who had left the New Seekers by then. With songs featuring Marty, Paul and Peter as leads showcasing their vocals, this is an interesting and well done effort released by Polydor. Marty Kristian of this group seems to be active in the sense of releasing as late as 2011 albums of demo recordings from the `1970's, available on the New Seekers web site. But for specific fans of Marty, this album features him as lead on 9 tracks, including the previously unreleased New Seekers Come Softly To Me, as well as the very impressive A Woman Grows, (which I'm surprised has not been picked up and recorded by others more recently in covers having a great deal of potential) written and sung as well as the more rocking A Midnight Woman. Indeed, Marty Kristian was and maybe still is not only a talented vocalist, but a very talented lyricists. So, if you enjoyed the vocals of the New Seekers, get this LP where you can, as you will be surprised and delighted in revisiting this early 1970's group.\",\n",

EA obviously has a great deal of talent, but apparently doesn't have any idea what to do with it. Most of the tracks on Fight Like a Girl are well-played but hideously overwrought. She seemingly has more pretentions than Diamanda Galas, Danielle Dax, and Lydia Lunch combined. Frankly, her precursors played the psychogirl makes good shtick decades ago. EA adds very little to the Femme Fatale Suicide Crew except her classical pedigree and her veneer of steampunk electrosheen. An artist earns her lyrical pretensions by rising above what she can't overcome and finding a reason for the world's injustice and moral randomness. EA is still in the abyss of self-pity, nihilism, and misanthropy. Maybe she'll grow as an artist, but right now she's little more than Nine Inch Nails for angst-ridden teenage girls.\",\n",

Particularly through the lyrical parts you miss the keyboard fills.  The mix is somewhat redeemed in the \"battle sequence\" but the guitar-sequencer counter point really made that movement shine.  Throughout there are EQ problems and EV excursions that detract from the overall composition.  Some might argue that I am just so smitten with the original that I can\\'t see anything good with the new version.  Well, that may be partially true.

Sanguindrake's sonic and emotional universe is recognizably the one we live in, but shown to us more lovely and uncanny than we usually know. Sanguindrake have been for a long time one L.A. band I try to see every chance I can; now everyone gets to hear.\",\n",

As Believers, we are always told to be with God- but we are often so busy doing things for God that we miss the miracle of what happens when we get quiet in His presence. This CD will help you slow down and breathe and say Selah and be reminded that God loves you more for who you are than what you do! The songs are classics- each and every one and the musicians bring a reverent excellence to each track. My favorite is \"Praise The Lord He Never Changes,\" a song I first heard Evie do back in the day- but have never forgotten it and was delighted to see it included in this presentation.

Decades past and the music oddly remains obscure. Now, Os Cemps, a very large group of musicians led by Oscar Fernndez, playing many forms of instruments, from the bagpipe to hurdy-gurdy to guitar to flutes to violins to various percussion, such as scrapers, tambourines, and drums, presents their fifth and best album, Tentemozo. The music, dance instrumentals and vocals, is bright and diverse in arrangements and moods. A blend of Celtic lilts and old Moorish elements, it reminds me of the music of Renaissance France's Provence. Here are ballads and rich, cheerful dances, such as a funny polka. The harmonies are thick and the beats are strong, producing alternating visions of courtly and festive village dances. The last track of the 42-minute long album excerpts a 1904 archived recording as introduction to a modern take of the song. In short, this album is filled with musical smiles. This is a lovingly produced album that should bring the happy Galician sound once more to the popular attention of us on this side of the Atlantic.\",\n",

The scope of music ranges from pure thrash metal as in the days of old Megadeth and Metallica to modern heavy metal.\\nDiabolic - A song about a guy going postal! Hard hitting in your face thrash\\nThunderman - A song about a rebel running from the law on his motorcycle. Thrash songs that mixes classic metal riffs with a modern sound.\\nSeven Deadly Sins - The songs is about a vampire and his newly turned vampiress wife.\\nThe Graveyard - A neat songs sang in first person about an undead grave party. - Pure thrash classic\\nWarTorn - This song is about a veteran who is having trouble coping with his memories of war. Moderate paced heavy rock songs A++.\\nAwaken Underworld - This song is simply an instrumental into to Destroyer of Men.\\nDestroyer of Men - Combined with Awaken Underworld this song runs over 10 minutes in length. It is a full on classic heavy metal epic journey. This song is one of my favorites and is very progressive.\\nLove to Death - A semi-ballad about a man committing suicide. This song has radio written all over it and is incredible.\\nOne Crow Sorrow - This songs shows more of the band\\'s musical versatility. A mix of Black Sabbath and Alice in Chains but heavier.\\nVillains - Probably my favorite track from the album. This songs sings about the new world order and uses generic comic characters as a interesting juxtaposition to reality.

       "  'reviewText': 'After teasing us with a proggy intro to a more pop-heavy album in \"Delicate Friction\" last year, The Mommyheads really get their prog-pop on this time with \"Vulnerable Boy\", exploring sounds we\\'ve never heard before while at the same time retaining that signature Mommyheads appeal.  But to merely label the Mommyheads as prog-pop does them a disservice, as there\\'s lots to explore here.  This is a rare album that has both instant accessibility and rewards for repeat-listeners, something for long-time fans and for those out there who might be saying \"The Mommy-whos?\"\\n\\n\"On A Clear Night\" kicks things off with a sparse, beautiful piano melody reminiscent of early Tony Banks.  Adam Elk\\'s vocals come in like a lullaby, and we think we know where this is going to take us, but then the drums and guitars kick in and we\\'re happily off in Mommyheads land, where music can be both poppy and experimental, daring and familiar.  This track links nicely with the following track, \"Gimme Silence\", continuing with a new piano theme, leading to a percussion and bass pattern that reminded me of Radiohead\\'s \"The Raindrops\" but with warmth and funk.  This takes us to the 6/4 beat \"Science and Reason\", showing that pop, rock and prog can peacefully coexist in the same track.  Next up is the epic, wonderful \"Medicine Show\", probably the album\\'s defining track, a fact that the Mommyheads have underscored by using part of the lyrics for the album\\'s title.  A lovely acoustic guitar and vocal melody gives way to thumping fuzz bass and layers of keyboards and vocals bordering on chaotic, but somehow the Mommyheads effortlessly steer us through it all and we\\'re happy to be along on the journey.\\n\\n \"My Intruder\" and \"Skinny White Uptight\" highlight the more abrasive side of the band, the former track with dark cynicism and the latter with self-effacing humor.  \"Devastate Me\" takes a sparse keyboard riff and puts some real bounce into it, \"Right Where They Should Be\" and \"Out on the Cliffs\" are classic Mommyheads.  \"Force of Will\" features a fun little keyboard trill that should sound dated but doesn\\'t.  \"Silent Age\" has a man-on-the-corner skiffle feel to it, and \"Bleed From a Glass\" ends on a subdued note, returning to the piano themes of the early tracks.  Bonus track \"No One Gives a Damn About Your Band\" comes off as fun rather than bitter, although god knows the Mommyheads have a right to be.  As a fan I will say it\\'s a shame that a Mommyheads masterpiece such as \"Hello Friends\" has a handful of views on YouTube while Train\\'s \"Soul Sister\" rakes in millions.  Both are good songs but the Mommyheads deserve their recognition too!\\n\\nOverall, I found \"Vulnerable Boy\" to be an ambitious, highly listenable mix.  In one sense, the first four tracks make up a complete \"suite\", and we\\'re left breathless and wanting more.  And while the rest of the tracks are fine (and at times, great), they lack some of the sonic majesty of those first four tracks.  I get the sense that they were really trying to stretch themselves in the front end of the album.  In particular \"Skinny White Uptight\" sticks out as not really belonging here, but damned if the track isn\\'t catchy.  And that\\'s one of the reasons I love the Mommyheads.  As soon as you try to define them or pigeonhole them, they say \"Wait, but what if we did this?\"  You end up getting the best of both worlds: invention and accessibility, in one great-sounding package.  I can\\'t wait to see what these guys do next.',\n",

I loved getting the first album from them. However, I decided, well Amazon is a cheaper place to get the disc, so I bought it from here, thinking I'd get the same thing. I ordered Act II and the Night Of Queen from Amazon, and they seem to be some sort of third party burnt junk. Both CD's are identical, literally, just with the CD's name changed on their cover. They come in a jewel case you can purchase at any Staples, and the covers are two pages. The first page being the front cover with the track list on the back, and the second page is the EXACT SAME PAGE. It's astounding just how bad it is. I'm going to be reordering the CD's from the Protomen website, because that's the CD I want. Not something that looks like it's some middle schooler's first burnt CD. I'm highly upset with these purchases, and if you're looking to get the amazing physical CD with Lyric book and all that, DO NOT buy it from Amazon.\",\n",

They are not real instruments, and that's why anyone who listens to this album won't notice much life or dynamics in the music -because it's made with synthesized instruments, not real ones.\\n\\nI think it's nice that someone would want to put effort into making a Meshuggah tribute album, but I can't say it's, at all, cool for someone to just MIDI his/her/their way through it and put a price-tag on it.\\n\\nBecause it is not real instruments, and because it sounds so bland, I think this should have been something thrown on a website for free -not something someone puts on Amazon, iTunes, or any other website, for sale. I hope the makers aren't offended. This is just my opinion. I think that as a fan effort this is awesome. But there's nothing here that justifies charging for it. It's not this person's original work, it in now way supports the band, and the creator/s of this album didn't use real instruments.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I love the sound of this CD; Children 18:3 is extremely gifted. Their sound is a little harder than I usually listen to, but it really caught my ear when I previewed it. Every song isn\\'t hard rockin\\', but most have some component of that in them. However, many also have a softer side to them. If you\\'re looking for a mostly heavy, upbeat, hard rockin\\' CD but enjoy a touch of softer songs, this CD is for you.\\n\\nContent-wise, their music is geared towards youth and young adults, however I (47) could also relate to many of their topics & themes. I especially liked \"Moment to Moment\" where he points out \"Every task before you is a challenge to succeed\"; that message is timeless no matter how old/young you are. Some of their songs are a little more nebulous than I like. My favorite song \"What About Justice\" sounds great, but I can\\'t quite figure out what it\\'s about. It may be clear to others, and it\\'s ok to have songs that have room for interpretation, but I like mine a little more straight forward. : )\\n\\nThe reason I didn\\'t give them 5 stars is that I like my Christian CDs to actually mention Jesus overtly at least a few times. To exclude the name of Jesus completely allows unbelievers or immature believers to hear the entire CD and never hear the name above all names, Jesus. To be sure, there are some Christian overtones & undertones in the CD, but this is part of the epidemic of CDs that don\\'t name Jesus even once: Third Day, \"Revelation\"; NeedToBreathe, \"The Outsiders\" & \"The Reckoning\"; Brit Nichole, \"The Lost Get Found\"; to name a very few. If groups like the OC Supertones & Christafari can have brilliant music, excellent lyrics, openly declare the name of Jesus, and be very successful, why don\\'t others?\\n\\nIn the end I really like this CD and recommend it.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Amazon.com review David Anthony Hollingsworth has a written a long, erudite and persuasive review extolling the virtues of this recording and an appreciation of the opera in general; I hope I may be allowed the privilege of an open forum to disagree with him respectfully and reluctantly, insofar as I am not the least surprised by its neglect even though I heartily endorse his championing of previously celebrated French operas now fallen into desuetude.\\n\\nI do not, in all honesty, hear much that persuades me this is a neglected masterpiece. It has a romantic and worthy history, being very much sui generis in content and theme, despite its partial indebtedness to Wagner, having had to be resurrected by the devotion of the composer\\'s friend, who reconstructed the score of Acts 1 and III from memory once they had been lost in a fire.\\n\\nMy problem is primarily with the lack of variety and the determined portentousness of the music itself. It is beautifully scored but so monochrome in mood that after the first fifteen minutes I found myself desperate for musical relief, which finally arrived in the shape of Jean-Luc Viala\\'s aria for the poet in paradise. For the most part, I can detect little in the way of shape or melody; the music meanders along aimlessly, shepherded by a succession of impressionistic gestures but remaining essentially moribund. It makes for a very long three hours. Of course, my reaction is very subjective and others seem to hear something I cannot, but nor can I say that the fairly simplistic human story, sandwiched between two Acts stuffed with allegorical characters representing various virtues and traits such as Truth, Goodness, Beauty and Suffering, really enthrals me; I prefer my moral attributes to be operatically enshrined in the depiction of real characters. Some might fairly condemn the libretto as more pretentious than anything Hofmannsthal and Strauss ever penned; certainly I\\'d prefer the dynamism and moral resonance of FROSCH any day.\\n\\nThe Wagnerian introduction is grand and slow-moving but hardly of a character to justify the conferring upon Magnard by some the title of \"the French Bruckner\"; his music is far more static and devoid of momentum. True, it shares a devotional ambience and a preponderance of massive blocks of polychromatic sound with minor key cadences and this quality is intensified by the resonant acoustic of the Toulouse recording venue: the Halle des Grains.\\n\\nMy other reservations centre upon the singing rather than the music itself. Not that Jos van Dam is anything other than vocally superb and commanding and my admiration extends to several other singers, including the intense, vibrant Hildegard Behrens and the rich, steady Nathalie Stutzmann. However, the other French lady singers in the cast, including those who impersonate the abstract beings and Nadine Denize are generally rather shrill and blowsy, while Gary Lakes\\' tenor is harsh and edgy. The choir, the Orfen Donostiarra, is decidedly inconsistent, with some squally sopranos and several instances of poor intonation throughout.\\n\\nAs French fin de sicle operas go, this one went; I would far prefer to champion the revival of Chausson\\'s \"Le roi Arthus\" than this lumbering and oh-so earnest work. I readily concede that others think differently but for all that I always wanted to like this opera, it left me bored.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'To American audiences A.R. Rahman is known as the Slumdog Millionaire composer. Danny Boyle used him once again for 127 Hours and he was able to prove that he is not just an \"Indian\" composer. People Like Us is indeed an interesting choice for the composer and he does indeed demonstrate a more mature and subtle side. People Like Us is writer Alex Kurtzman\\'s directorial debut, and he noted that music was a very important part of the film. Based off the score you can tell how integral the score is. The music is a very distinct narrative as the score flows in dramatic fashion with subtle character nuances and emotional beats.\\n\\nIt\\'s really tough to make a modern un-stylized drama score without being one-note and boring. This is a character drama that is solely about the characters and their lives. There is no crazy situations or aliens or anything for the music to absorb. The score absorbes the characters and Rahman is able to mold a very nice story of it. The score works as a whole piece and must be experiences as a full listen from beginning to end. There really aren\\'t any standout tracks that define the score. He introduces his central motif in the first track and that serves as the structure for the whole score\\'s soundscape. The piano and guitar are the most notably featured instruments and as naturally solo instruments they add a distinct human touch to the music. As we come to the end we wrap up the subtle journey in a heartwarming fashion. Everything works out at the end of this story and while some people may find that cliche and cheesy, it does leave you with a nice feeling inside.\\n\\nThe score is thoroughly enjoyable and does a lot by doing very little. The tone stays pretty much the same the whole way through, and that may be my only gripe. It rarely shifts into heavy emotional territory and because of that it\\'s hard to pick up the conflict of the story within the music. A.R. Rahman handles the whole thing very well and executes it with a uniformed touch. It may be too one-note at times, but the strength of the story in the music makes the characters very identifiable and it becomes a human story we can all feel. An above average modern drama score that shows A.R. Rahman\\'s more universal side.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': '\"Cycle\" is the second release from Japanese composer/musician/architect/sculptor/painter Takashi Suzuki, following \"Resonance\" (2011), which was named Best Ambient Album for 2011 by Zone Music Reporter and reached #2 on the July 2011 ZMR Radio Airplay Chart. Like \"Resonance,\" the music on \"Cycle\" is very soothing and relaxing ambient electronica. Although much of the music has a rather dark quality, it feels more like the darkness of infinite space or of nighttime than anything frightening or sad. It is interesting to note that Suzuki approaches his recordings in much the same way he approaches his paintings - one at a time, finishing one before moving on to the next, allowing the previous pieces to influence the ones that come next. Because of that, the album feels linear and plays as a continuous musical experience. Each of the eight tracks has been given an Episode number, leaving it up to the listener to discern what the music is \"about\" - if it is about anything specific at all. Suzuki uses a variety of keyboards and synthesizers to create this music, some of which are newer and some that are vintage. All of the Episodes have melodic passages as well as subtle rhythms and dynamics, and this music works equally well as a backdrop for quiet activities, music for relaxation, and music to get lost in. The sound quality is superb.\\n\\nBecause the continuity of the album causes it to play as one continuous piece, describing each track isn\\'t too useful. If you enjoy space music, ambient music with depth and substance, and very minimalist music for relaxation, Takashi Suzuki\\'s music is an excellent choice. Check it out!',\n",

So is the landscape cover-photo of an iceberg.\\n\\nOf course, then there is an exception.  Soundings II, as the composer says, is a study-work for the flute, providing a wide range of techniques to be practiced.  OK, that sounds like it would be a go-nowhere collection of study pieces.  But this piece seems to actually work.  To me, it appears to be a landscape study that unfolds the various moods and qualities that make a place unique and fulfilling to be in.  No, not much development, but interesting scene building.\\n\\nFour To Go, ok, that set of 4 pieces seemed to stagnate as well and have no cohesion.  These also seemed to be study pieces for an instrument, in this case a clarinet, but they did not build or develop.  This was more like naked displays of one technique after another, with little concern for momentum, cohesion, or the piece as a whole.  The third movement of the piece, Caught In Time (that\\'s the tempo instructions) is the namesake of the entire album.  And it does seem to be stuck in time, not in a good way.  The fourth and last movement, Relentlessly Yet Always Rockin\\' (again, the tempo instructions), was jazzy but so monotonous.  So \"Four to Go\" seemed to have it\\'s title not in a good way.  Sort of like \"Hang in there, you just have four to go!\"\\n\\nAnd on and on the disk goes, with \"Percorsi d\\'anima\", Incroci\", and \"Quattro chaicchiere ed un apertivo\", the third of which presents a jazzy riff that reminds one of Charlie Brown music or Claude Bolling; in other words, derivative, a cliche.\\n\\nIn the last set, \"Three Songs on the Poetry of Yeats\", the music serves as the accompaniment to the voice line, and was more satisfying than the previous works.  It then struck me that this was the issue with all the pieces, save the first: they were an accompaniment to nothing, needing a lead line to get them \"unstuck\".',\n",

After having songs still fresh in my head i googled the band and saw they had a new cd, and Joe had written a book (good point of view from \"real\" rock n roll lifestyle on the road\") So i instantly bought it because everything they make is great.\\n\\nFrom the first seconds of the cd I loved it, they added some details to their sound I think in Brick and Mortar.  The music sounds more refined but still a rocking good time.  its hard to rank their music becuase nothings better than anything else...its a cd you don\\'t skip songs on...you listen through again...and again... and again.\\n\\nThe best chance for a hit single from them IMHO is on this cd...not saying its my favorite song...what the general population would like...\"Never could have made it without you\" is very catchy and anyone happily in a relationship can instantly relate to it.  The lyrics are great, very lovey dovy kinda song.  Thats why I could see a chance for a \"pop\" break through.  I am keeping my fingers crossed for Watershed!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'There is a preview of Allison Iraheta\\'s upcoming album circulating on the internet. It includes 30-second clips of all the songs and is severely disappointing. You just have to ask, \"Where did her voice go?\" It sounds nothing like her American Idol studio recordings or live performances, which were jaw dropping at times. I do not understand why record execs do this all the time with American Idol contestants. On Idol, her recordings of \"Give in to Me,\" \"I Can\\'t Make You Love Me,\" and \"Cry Baby\" (to name a few) are pure and magical, with an undeniable raw rock edge. On the new CD, with the exception of maybe one or two songs, Allison Iraheta sounds like a cheap knockoff of P!nk. Her \"voice\" goes into completely uncharted territory, and that\\'s not a good thing -- it\\'s a fake thing. With this generic, imitation pop music, they\\'ve taken the enormous potential this girl had and effectively flushed it down the toilet. All originality is gone; they\\'re merely trying to create a second generation P!nk-Kelly Clarkson clone.\\n\\nWhen \"Friday I\\'ll Be Over U,\" a splendid track, was released, it was rumored that the reason for it being a little more poppy than expected was simply so it could get the attention of mainstream fans. We were told not to worry -- the album would be the REAL Allison. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is MORE poppy than FIBOU, and the \"real\" Allison is nowhere to be found. In fact, her voice is mostly unrecognizable. Even on songs like \"Scars,\" which is very vocal-centered without a lot of instrumentation, Allison has obviously been instructed to sing in an unnatural way, and her near-a cappella voice sounds contrived.\\n\\nShame on you, Allison, for allowing this to happen. For now, I will continue to listen to your pure recordings and dream about what could have been.\\n\\nOIG',\n",

So, this is not only a five-star performance, but amongst the very finest that exist, and the best that I know of. The merits of the performance are already well-known, so there does not seem any real purpose in giving such a fabulous and well-known performance a star rating. Rather, the purpose of this particular release is its transfer to SACD, apparently directly from the master tapes ... which brings one to the sonics.\\n\\nThese recordings were made in analogue in 1970 -1973 on a Bosendorfer at Schlo&szlig; Klesheim in Salzburg ... tuned about a half-semitone higher than normal pitch. They have always had an unusual resonant sonic ... I have seen others who have complained about it ... but I have always found the sound quite ethereal, and rather well-suited to Herr Bach. So what does SACD do for it?\\n\\nThe answer is .... odd things. The sound on my original redbook CD release is more raw, more natural, and oddly closer to a natural piano sound than the SACD release. The SACD version sound is sometimes clear, and sometimes muted, and it has unusual piano harmonics. Sometimes, the voicing of parts seems peculiar, or that something is missing. Or sometimes it seems that one part (usually in the mid-range) has unusual clarity, but the other parts are out of balance. The bass line is often emaciated. I couldn't understand this. Then, I listened with headphones ... and I noticed that whereas the original CD version is VERY hissy (unpleasantly so with headphones, but perfectly fine listening with speakers), the SACD version with headphones has almost no hiss whatsoever. And that, I suspect, is the clue to the problem. This is not just a raw transfer from the original analogue tapes to DSD ... Rather, it has been de-greased, wiped with disinfectant, anti-mould and decongestant. To my ears, it sounds rather like the dubious EMI re-releases onto SACD: something that has been so severely over-processed, nuked and radiated ... that the sound has become 'weird'.\\n\\nFor standard stereo loudspeaker listening, I much prefer my original redbook CD version: the CD version is vastly more natural and more balanced. For headphone listening, I do find the hiss of the original CD a problem, but I am not sure I would want the weird sonics of the SACD version either. Overall then, the SACD version is sadly disappointing. If you do not already have this set, I would go for the standard CD version: far less expensive, and far superior.\\n\\nPresentation: 4 green Martian discs nicely presented in a standard 4-box CD case. The green SACDs are similar to those used in single-layer SHM-SACDs, but these are hybrids. The artwork design very nicely matches the original CD release I have. Notes are in Japanese, but track listings etc are in English and Japanese\",\n",

It is merely an upgrading of the original synthesized music, with newer synthesized music. The result: the same arrangements as the original, with better quality. In fact, when I first listened to it, I couldn't tell a difference. That is until I compared it to the original soundtrack, then I could hear the far better quality and better synth.\\n\\nHere's why I'm on the fence: there are only 16 tracks on this CD. When you arrange a soundtrack this is understandable. You take a selection of tracks and arrange them, bringing new life to the songs. So in doing this, its reasonable to do a handful of songs from the original soundtrack. However, if your merely upgrading the sound, then why not upgrade all 44 tracks from the original soundtrack? Then that would make this a worthy purchase. After all, Secret of Mana had some beautiful melodies and really deserved one or the other. But this album is neither a true arranged album, nor a fully improved soundtrack. It's more of a sampling on what Secret of Mana could have sounded like if it was better synthesized.\\n\\nSong List:\\n\\n1. Genesis ~ Fear of the Heavens - 1:41\\n\\n2.

I won't subscribe to satellite radio, but I do listen to Pandora on the Internet sometimes. But this is not the Esthero I fell in love with over a decade ago. The Breath From Anther CD will always be a favorite, but I have been waiting for her to come back with that kind of flavor for a long time. Wikked Lil' Grrrls CD was okay. I didn't like the title track, but out of the 16 tracks on there I loved 4 of them. Beautiful Lie, Thank Heaven 4 You, My Torture, and Gone feat. Cee Lo Green. But the rest of the songs never got played more than 4 or 5 times.\\nThis new song sounds like something Cyndi Lauper would have put out in the 80's. I bought the 5 versions of it hoping at least one of them would grow on me, but alas none have. I looked up the up coming tracks on Wikipedia and looked up most of the songs listed on Esthero's new album and I am so disappointed. They all sound like pop music, not the cool trip-hop, R&B, jazzy flavor I have come to love from Esthero like So Many Times w/Miquel, Another Great Love Gone By w/Vikter Duplaix and Shine w/Boney James. If you don't have those three cuts, download them now for a taste of Esthero with great flavor.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Well what we have here is a brutal death metal band, that is fronted by a female vocalist.  Ain\\'t that an oxymoron.  I mean, Arch Enemy aren\\'t really anything -they\\'re like the \"pop\" version of death metal, meaning they ain\\'t real death metal. But let me tell ya, Angela Gossow doesn\\'t sound like this! This is HEAVY friggin\\' death metal -had I not read up on the band, I\\'d have thought this was a male vocalist...\\n\\nThe music is hyper fast, hyper heavy and even quite technical.  The production is modern in the sense that it\\'s a newer recording but don\\'t let that fool ya. The guitars are not wanky, mid-toned, or weak. I mean it when I say, they are friggin\\' heavy!  And the soloing is superb -above par.  With this type of death metal, it\\'s harder to \"hear\" the bass -an issue a lot of bands have.  The bass does have moments and is felt but follows the guitars and song patterns rather than being a counter point -like say on Gorguts\\' \"Obscura\".\\n\\nThe drumming, is fantastic.  I mean this guy is no Derek Roddy, John Longstreth, or George Kollias BUT he does a bang up job (pun intended).  His double kick work is beyond reproach (though they\\'re triggered) and he isn\\'t just a double kick nut, he actually plays the kit and adds some color with splashes, chinas and bells. I would watch this guy to see if he guests on other bands albums.  Very talented.\\n\\nI still can\\'t get over the fact that this is a female vocalist. I mean, there are a lot more girls (women) in extreme metal now than ever.  I mean Jo Bench is the longest running, having been Bolt Thrower\\'s bassist for about 25 years or so. This lady, Mallika Sundaramurthy, is just beyond finding anything wrong with her performance.  If you do, you\\'re looking WAY too freaking hard, really. She is perfect for this. I bet had I not mentioned it, no one who didn\\'t already know would\\'ve known. Don\\'t take my word for it: listen to the samples.\\n\\nLook, this is more for the technical brutal death metal crowd. If you\\'re a fan of bands in the vein of Origin -then give these guys/gal a listen. Seriously, this is some good stuff!  Highly recommended!',\n",

We are hooked in once again by Vanessa\\'s healing sensual voice drifting effortlessly between french and english with those to die for melodies and that layered, rich and dreamy production we have come to expect. It\\'s all here,  losing nothing of the song craft or dextrous musicianship of the debut album, not at all, it\\'s all there just as i hoped and dreamed it would be... even without the talent of a certain James Iha this time round.. although Mr Iha has doffed his cap to the O\\'s by releasing his own version of The O\\'s track \\'Till Next Tuesday\\' on his new album \\'Look To The Sky\\', another fine album to savour if you haven\\'t already.\\n\\nLa Ballade d\\'O was my unexpected album of the century, Stories For Watering Skies had a big responsibility on it\\'s shoulders to follow it, I didn\\'t think it could possibly be improved upon but I can say now as I discover this album more and more the impossible is achieved.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/La-Ballade-d-O/dp/B000FBIYMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">La Ballade d\\'O</a>',\n",

The first track, Exit Wounds, pretty much sets the stage for the EP and gives a great idea of what to expect for the next 16 minutes - and that is well-rounded, solid metal that courts hard rock.\\n\\nThe pacing of the EP stays relatively even until a brief break in tempo with Crush. As bands with excellent singers tend to do, the tempo is eased a bit and we get treated to something more along the lines of a ballad. But don't let me ruin the song for you with a boring step-by-step breakdown - just check it out. Depending on your tastes, I doubt you'll be disappointed.\\n\\nIf you're looking for something that isn't ear-blisteringly loud and powerful with four-and-a-half million BPM and is just good music, you could do a lot worse than chucking four bones at this album.\",\n",

Why on earth would Paul McCartney desecrate his most-famed song by singing about scrambled eggs?\\n\\nIt is because that was how he originally wrote it.  Paul has often remarked about how he will get a good tune in his head and fill in the words with jibberish just to keep the tune going until he can commit it to tape or memory.  As the story goes, McCartney had dreamt the music to \"Yesterday\" and woke up coming up with the first thing he could to keep the tune going:  \"Scrambled Eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs.\"  The song existed as such for weeks until he was sure he didn\\'t plagiarize the music from someone else.  At that point, the proper lyrics were written and history was made.\\n\\nAlmost fifty years later, the idea was revisited with Paul\\'s appearance on Jimmy Fallon\\'s show and additional lyrics were written under the original vein.  Paul even managed to work in a somewhat awkward vegitarian plug with the almost sung verse on chicken wings.\\n\\nIt\\'s fun, strange, and unique.  It isn\\'t too rediculous and they make sure to keep the spontaneous sound of the rewrite during the performance without trying too hard.\\n\\nI left a star off because for as much of a McCartney fan that I am, I didn\\'t enjoy it as much as I thought I would for whatever reason.',\n",

This is the follow-up to \"Palmhenge\" from 2005, and the bar was set mighty high with that great record. I\\'m so pleased to say \"Tilting\" is as good or better. Certainly it\\'s more stylistically diverse, and there are no weak tracks. \"Measure Of the Man\" leads off with an appealing Irish feel and a strong lyric. My favorite tracks are \"Destiny Misspent\", a thoughtful mediation on time and lessons learned, \"Sick Cynthia Thing\", a vintage rocker with extremely amusing lyrics, and \"Whittled Down\" the saga of a lost musician. I could rave on and on but if you are a fan of great songs written honestly from the heart this is for you. Get it now! Thanks Johnny.',\n",

The songs are very singable and meaningful.\\n\\nYou can stream the entire album at [...]\\n\\nNotes:\\nOne aim of this album was to introduce some new songs that churches in Scotland might find useful in their own unique worship services. Scottish traditional music and folk melodies have an adaptable quality that renders the best of them timeless. Paraphrases from the Scottish Psalter like Psalm 23 have been sung across the world for centuries, and it's important to remind new generations that these ancient words of scripture remain profoundly relevant. Scottish writers like Horatius Bonar and James Montgomery showed that a wealth of transforming biblical truths could be taught and absorbed through songs, so we also wanted to introduce examples of their lyrics to new listeners.\\n\\nThe motivation for making this hymns recording did not spring simply from a desire to create art. Hymnwriting is about making music firstly out of gratitude to Jesus Christ. With all our imperfections and limitations, Christians struggle to express anything more than an echo of His greatness, but we believe that this is a thing eminently worth sharing. For the person who finds this idea strange, it will hopefully make more sense as you listen! Our hope is that every listener might hear the joy that comes from the gospel: the good news of God's saving and transforming love, made available to every person through his son, Jesus.\\n\\nABOUT NEW SCOTTISH ARTS\\nNew Scottish Arts is an arts outreach & education ministry. Our purpose is to serve the Christian community in Scotland by enabling Christians to share their faith through the creative arts, by facilitating vibrant outreach events and projects that will impact on local communities and the whole of Scotland.\",\n",

The guitars and bass play every piece note by note from the game and the drummer has an excellent interpretation of it. The tones of the instruments are fitting to the music and sound great. If you are unfamiliar with the soundtrack of Mega Man II, the music is in a sense a bit repetitive, but the motifs are amazing and totally catchy which makes up for it. I believe that this soundtrack defies the test of time. Mega Man II was released in 1988 and the soundtrack is still one of the most creative, catchy, and inspiring (provided you are a musician or if you are working out) pieces of work and the Bit Brigade revised and polished it from an 8-bit composition to a real live rock/metal sound. I love how they also incorporated a little Mega Man III in there. I believe one track is also from Mega Man IV. To me this is one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever. I'm jealous that the Bit Brigade got to play this music live before I did. lol\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"My interest was more than piqued when I heard that Mike Scheidt, the frontman, guitarist and vocalist of the Doom/Sludge/Stoner Juggernaut 'Yob', had put out a solo acoustic album.\\n\\nThose of you who have seen Yob live know that the men behind the music are just as eclectic and profound as the colossal highs and gut-wrenching lows that Yob evokes in it's listeners.  So, to you, prospective listener, I ask you this:\\n\\nBefore you hit play, you need to take a deep breath, and treat this as something exclusive from all other works.  It is not, in any way similar to not only those styles, but the emotions evoked.  It is an entirely different animal-- no, it's an entirely different species; life form, maybe.  This, to some, should come as no surprise.\\n\\nWhat we have here is something that's not necessarily 'powerful' in the sense that a listener would be used to-- you have to hunt for it, a bit.  If you're an audiophile like I consider myself, this should come as no surprise.  Good music grows on you-- sometimes like a sickness, sometimes like a deep, profound joy.  This album kind of did both.\\n\\nThere is definitely something altogether eclectic and strange about Scheidt's lyrical presence in this record-- his first two tracks have sparse instrumentals, and mainly focus on him setting the stage for this emotional journey.  He constructs, presents, and confronts-- although a bit abstractly- a lineup of his own demons, and kills them systematically with kindness, joy, love, and pure emotional vulnerability.  It's alien flower-power, but it also displays exactly where one would imagine Scheidt's soul to reside-- and this is what I think separates Scheidt's vision from a good lot of other artists and musicians: Scheidt's biggest weapon (and in Yob, too) is his ability to turn anything into lead.  His airy, shy vocals in this album give way sometimes and the sheer profundity of the narrative is a bit staggering at times.  Some won't like this style from Scheidt, some will be indifferent, and others will accept it with, just as he presents it, open arms.\\n\\nI find myself having a difficult time quantifying this album-- I don't think it should be critiqued the way that other albums so helplessly rise and fall.  It's designed to be intimate-- to be personal, so while I have an idea of how I would, hypothetically, quantify it, I'm going to leave it at a 4 star rating, not because it's good or great or, but because it asks to be heard in such a way that I think anything less wouldn't be doing Scheidt any justice.\",\n",

The melodies and lyrics are unique so it is certainly more of a \"tribute song\" than a \"cover\". The instrumental performances grow increasingly hyperactive and super-charged as the song \"progresses\" along. To its credit, however, it never strays too far from its point of inspiration. Even as the prog-rock quotient surpasses typical Kansas territory, the syncopations, arrangements and even stylistic bits all point back to classic Kansas.\\n\\nThis is a very high quality production that cleverly flirts with - yet never quite crosses - the line separating \"cover song\" from \"original\". If you like catchy melodic hard rock with excellent vocals, top notch prog-rock virtuosity on \"real\" instruments like drums, guitar, bass and keyboards, this is a fantastic song. Quite simply... IT ROCKS\\n\\nHot off the heels of successful single releases of Kansas and Beatles cover tunes, it should perhaps come as no surprise that neo-classic prog rockers Magellan\\'s first track from their newest album would carefully bridge the gap that separates \"cover\" from \"original\".  Hopefully some of Magellan\\'s new \"cover\" fans will make the transition over to buying and enjoying \"Inert Momentum\" a collecton which promises to be the first album of new compositions from the band in half a decade.\\n\\n\"Keep the Faith, Keep the Peace, Keep on Smiling!\"\\n\\nMark Stephens - ProgPositivity Radio\\n[...]',\n",

       "  'reviewText': '\"Wedding Classics\" is a selection of seventeen classical pieces (sixteen in the download version) arranged and performed for solo piano by Randi Rokke. This is Rokke\\'s third CD to date, following \"Joy,\" a Christmas collection, and \"Tell the Story,\" a collection of hymns, both released in 2009. A longtime music educator, church musician, and the wife and daughter of Lutheran pastors, Ms Rokke brings a lifetime of musical experience to her recordings. She has played the piano for many, many weddings over the years, and this collection is made up of favorites that she has used as preludes, postludes, processionals, and recessionals. Several of the pieces are very standard wedding faire - Wagner\\'s \"Bridal Chorus\" (often referred to as \"Here Comes the Bride\"), Mendelssohn\\'s \"Wedding March,\" and the venerable Pachelbel\\'s \"Canon in D,\" but there is also an assortment of other wedding-appropriate classical music that isn\\'t nearly as commonly heard. Along with being a very warm and pleasant CD to listen to, \"Wedding Classics\"  provides brides and wedding planners a one-stop sampler of music to choose from for that special day. The liner notes of the CD also give a brief but informative history of each piece and its composer. The CD contains a bonus track, \"Prelude In a Classic Style\" by Gordon Young, a contemporary composer who passed away in 1998. Several of these pieces were originally composed for organ or for orchestra, and Ms Rokke has arranged those for piano solo. The composers represented are Henry Purcell, George F. Handel (2), JS Bach (5), Charles Gounod, Richard Wagner, Claude Debussy (2), Gordon Young, Felix Mendelssohn, Johann Pachelbel, Cesar Franck, Jeremiah Clarke, and Edvard Grieg. My own favorites include Handel\\'s \"Thanks Be To Thee,\" Bach\\'s \"Cello Suite #1,\" Debussy\\'s \"Reverie,\" Young\\'s \"Prelude In Classic Style,\" Bach\\'s \"Arioso,\" Franck\\'s \"Panis Angelicus,\" and Grieg\\'s \"Wedding Day At Troldhaugen.\"\\n\\nThis album makes for very pleasant listening and is a handy tool for selecting music for a wedding.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Wil Blades is a young jazz organist and leads his sextet in a superb collection of his own compositions on this album.  His command of jazz is partly learned from formal studies, but clearly is driven by sounds and phrasings picked up over the years.  Blades is mostly a straight ahead jazz type, falling somewhere between a laidback Bay Area groover and a New Orleans funkster.  For a stronger New Orleans feel and pounding drum beat, try 32nd Street (tk 2) or the title track Sketchy (tk 7).  For a more swinging sound (in the jazz sense) check out the melodious and inspired solos on Why? (tk 1) and the soothing, lengthy organ and guitar solos on Where Go? (tk 4).  For a hard bop with smooth undertones, I recommend Mr. Lewis (tk 8) and for an easy-going funky track, play Mae Mae (tk 10). Good stuff all around.',\n",

He gets a good sound out the lower register approximating the sound of the upper register of the tenor. On the Hard Swing he plays alto sax 7 times and tenor sax 4 times.

       "  'reviewText': 'Every few years a new crop of Blues Rock guitarists appear on the scene, oozing out of garages, barrooms and off of street corners where the neighborhood watch committee finally got street light erected. It started in the `60s, really, with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and then the Americans, Mike Bloomfield, Ry Cooder, Johnny Winter. The 70s gave us Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top), Santana, Duane Allman, the 80s Mark Knopfler and so on. Kenny Wayne Shepard, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and many more have come on the scene since. It\\'s an attractive niche to try and fit into. It has so much room to shine. And it is easy to fail; get lost in the crowd. There\\'s the whole \"cross roads\" myth about having to sell your soul to really be granted that extra something that it takes to be the next Jimi Hendrix, the next Robert Johnson.\\n\\nDave Fields is in the new crop and he just may have it. Hi third album,  Detonation, explodes with a harder rocking sound drenched in many a variety of styles touching on classic rock , jazz-blues and reggae mixed in with a blast of blinding blues that pays tribute, most notably to Beck and Hendrix with nods to Buddy Guy (especially in those passages where the notes fly off his ax like shrapnel in the middle of soulful songs).\\n\\nFrom the first notes of the opening song, \"Addicted To Your Fire\" (which you\\'d have to be blind or deaf not to recognize Hendrix \"Stand Next To You Fire\" in) it is apparent that he is setting the bar at Jimi height.\\n\\nFields explores 1960s psychedelia on \"Prophet in Disguise,\" a melodic track with an Eastern-influenced guitar lick that is more David Gilmour than George Harrison. Track three is a favorite. \"Doin Hard Time,\" is slow, smoldering blues duet with Grammy Award Winning blues singer and guitarist,  Joe Louis Walker that works very well. Track five is a fun song, \"Bad Hair Day,\" is an interesting mix of reggae and the blues, vowing not to let his hair get him down.\\n\\nOn \"Better Be Good\" you can hear him channeling SRV to good effect. It delivers some social commentary and his guitar is at the best here as he pulls everything out of his bag of tricks. The purest blues tune on the album is probably \"Pocket Full Of Dust\", The guitar attacks and it stings. It\\'s soaked in blues soul ala Buddy Guy and the great Chicago stylists. The organ of Vladimir Barsky works well behind his guitar explosions and drummer Kenny Soule and bassist Andy Huenerberg round out his band quite well.\\n\\nDetonation is produced by David Z (Prince, Johnny Lang, Etta James, Buddy Guy) and  is a 12-song exploration of Fields\\'  electrifying guitar prowess. This album has the feel of Fields stepping out of the pure blues spot light and expanding his sound into more rock, but he never, like all the greats before him, completely abandons the blues, instead he has absorbed them and is ready to let the blues be his foundation for what he creates from here on out.\\n\\nThe Dirty Lowdown',\n",

On top of all this is a Zappa-esque effortless sarcasm that makes it apparent this is a man to whom nothing is sacred.\\n\\nThis is a more rap-heavy album and to my ears not as good as his work in Trailerpark, but there are still some fantastic songs, particularly In Gottes Namen, which, in trying to discern meaning from google translate, is a satirical song celebrating terrorism. Indeed, Alligatoah also goes by the name TopTerrorist, and satirizes Islam in ways few artists dare. Sure, he goes after the safe target of Christianity too.
